DESCRIPTION

 This contribution contains a formalisation of coalgebras,
 bisimulation on coalgebras, weakly final coalgebras and
 lambda-coiteration definition scheme. The formalisation is
 modular. The implementation of the module types for streams and
 potentially infinite Peano numbers are provided using the coinductive
 types.


USAGE

 The files should be compiled using Coq version 8.2 or higher.

 In order to compile the files using the provided Makefile simply call
 make:

 $ make

 Importing WeaklyFinalCoalgebra.v will import all the module
 types. LambdaCoiteration.v provides lambda-coiteration scheme on top
 of that. ZStreamCoalgebra.v and CoPeanoCoalgebra.v contain
 implementation modules for streams and potentially infinite Peano
 numbers. Usage examples are found in LambdaCoiterationExamples.v
